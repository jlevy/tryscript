title: tbd Workflow
description: Full tbd workflow guide for agents
---
**`tbd` helps humans and agents ship code with greater speed, quality, and discipline.**

1. **Beads**: Git-native issue tracking (tasks, bugs, features).
   Never lose work across sessions.
2. **Spec-Driven Workflows**: Plan features → break into beads → implement
   systematically.
3. **Shortcuts**: Reusable instruction templates for common workflows.
4. **Guidelines**: Coding rules and best practices.

## Installation

```bash
npm install -g get-tbd@latest
tbd setup --auto --prefix=<name>   # Fresh project (--prefix is REQUIRED and should be short. For new project setup, ALWAYS ASK THE USER FOR THE PREFIX; do not guess it)
tbd setup --auto                   # Existing tbd project (prefix already set)
tbd setup --from-beads             # Migration from .beads/ if `bd` has been used
```

## Routine Commands

```bash
tbd --help    # Command reference
tbd status    # Status
tbd doctor    # If there are problems

tbd setup --auto   # Run any time to refresh setup
tbd prime      # Restore full context on tbd after compaction
```

## CRITICAL: You Operate tbd — The User Doesn’t

**You are the tbd operator:** Users talk naturally; you translate their requests to tbd
actions. DO NOT tell users to run tbd commands.
That’s your job.

- **WRONG**: "Run `tbd create` to track this bug"

- **RIGHT**: *(you run `tbd create` yourself and tell the user it’s tracked)*

**Welcoming a user:** When users ask “what is tbd?”
or want help → run `tbd shortcut welcome-user`

## User Request → Agent Action

| User Says | You (the Agent) Run |
| --- | --- |
| "There's a bug where ..." | `tbd create "..." --type=bug` |
| "Let's work on issues" | `tbd ready` |
| "Build a TypeScript CLI" | `tbd guidelines typescript-cli-tool-rules` |
| "Improve eslint/monorepo" | `tbd guidelines typescript-monorepo-patterns` |
| "Add e2e/golden testing" | `tbd guidelines golden-testing-guidelines` |
| "Review changes" (TS) | `tbd guidelines typescript-rules` |
| "Review changes" (Python) | `tbd guidelines python-rules` |
| "Plan a new feature" | `tbd shortcut new-plan-spec` |
| "Break spec into beads" | `tbd shortcut plan-implementation-with-beads` |
| "Implement these beads" | `tbd shortcut implement-beads` |
| "Commit this" | `tbd shortcut commit-code` |
| "Create a PR" | `tbd shortcut create-or-update-pr-simple` |
| "Research this topic" | `tbd shortcut new-research-brief` |
| "Document architecture" | `tbd shortcut new-architecture-doc` |
| *(your choice whenever appropriate)* | `tbd list`, `tbd dep add`, `tbd close`, `tbd sync`, etc. |

## CRITICAL: Session Closing Protocol

**Before saying “done”, you MUST complete this checklist:**

```
[ ] 1. git add + git commit
[ ] 2. git push
[ ] 3. gh pr checks <PR> --watch 2>&1 (IMPORTANT: WAIT for final summary, do NOT tell user it is done until you confirm it passes CI!)
[ ] 4. tbd close/update <id> for all beads worked on
[ ] 5. tbd sync
[ ] 6. CONFIRM CI passed (if failed: fix, run tests, re-push, restart from step 3)
```

**Work is not done until pushed, CI passes, and tbd is synced.**

## Bead Tracking Rules

- Track all task work not done immediately as beads (discovered work, TODOs,
  multi-session work)
- When in doubt, create a bead
- Check `tbd ready` when not given specific directions
- Always close/update beads and run `tbd sync` at session end

## Commands

### Finding Work

| Command | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `tbd ready` | Beads ready to work (no blockers) |
| `tbd list --status open` | All open beads |
| `tbd list --status in_progress` | Your active work |
| `tbd show <id>` | Bead details with dependencies |

### Creating & Updating

| Command | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `tbd create "title" --type task\|bug\|feature --priority=P2` | New bead (P0-P4, not "high/medium/low") |
| `tbd update <id> --status in_progress` | Claim work |
| `tbd close <id> [--reason "..."]` | Mark complete |

### Dependencies & Sync

| Command | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `tbd dep add <bead> <depends-on>` | Add dependency |
| `tbd blocked` | Show blocked beads |
| `tbd sync` | Sync with git remote (run at session end) |
| `tbd stats` | Project statistics |
| `tbd doctor` | Check for problems |

### Documentation

| Command | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `tbd shortcut <name>` | Run a shortcut |
| `tbd shortcut --list` | List shortcuts |
| `tbd guidelines <name>` | Load coding guidelines |
| `tbd guidelines --list` | List guidelines |
| `tbd template <name>` | Output a template |

## Quick Reference

- **Priority**: P0=critical, P1=high, P2=medium (default), P3=low, P4=backlog
- **Types**: task, bug, feature, epic
- **Status**: open, in_progress, closed
- **JSON output**: Add `--json` to any command
