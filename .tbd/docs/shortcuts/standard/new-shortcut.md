Create a new shortcut for `tbd shortcut <name>`.

## Locations

- **Official** (bundled with tbd): `packages/tbd/docs/shortcuts/standard/<name>.md`
- **Project-level** (custom): `.tbd/docs/shortcuts/standard/<name>.md`

## Format

```markdown
---
title: [Title]
description: [One line for --list output]
author: Joshua Levy (github.com/jlevy) with LLM assistance
---
[Concise instructions. Focus on what's specific to this task.
Skip obvious steps the agent would figure out.
Reference other shortcuts/guidelines/templates as needed.]
```

## Naming

Use kebab-case: `new-<thing>`, `<verb>-<noun>`, `<thing>-<variant>`

Examples: `commit-code`, `new-plan-spec`, `review-code-typescript`

## Key Principles

- **Be concise**: Skip boilerplate the agent already knows
- **Be specific**: Include non-obvious details, file paths, patterns to follow
- **Reference, don’t duplicate**: Point to `tbd shortcut/guidelines/template` commands
- **Trust the agent**: They’ll adapt to context

## Testing

```bash
tbd shortcut <name>      # Verify output
tbd shortcut --list      # Verify listing
```

For official shortcuts: `pnpm build` in packages/tbd/

## Shortcuts vs Guidelines

- **Shortcuts**: Workflows to follow (process)
- **Guidelines**: Rules to reference (knowledge)

See `tbd shortcut new-guideline` for creating guidelines.
